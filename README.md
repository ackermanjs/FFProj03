## Description
As a potential pet owner, I want to use a pet adoption app to find my perfect furry companion.
I start by opening the pet adoption app and browsing through the available pets. I can filter my search by pet type, breed, age, and location to find pets that match my preferences.
I find a few pets that I'm interested in and click on their profiles to learn more about them. The profiles include pictures, descriptions, and information about the pet's personality, health, and behavior.
If I find a pet that I'm interested in adopting, I can contact the adoption agency directly through the app to ask questions or schedule a visit. I can also save pets that I'm interested in for future reference.
Once I've found the perfect pet, I can complete the adoption process through the app. This includes filling out an adoption application, submitting references, and paying any adoption fees.
Finally, I can use the app to stay connected with the adoption agency and receive updates about my new pet, including information about training, health care, and socialization opportunities.
With the pet adoption app, I feel confident that I can find my perfect furry companion and provide them with a loving forever home.
